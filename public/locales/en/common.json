Hearify creates really interesting questions, that make sense - I admired it. I tried it with the difficult topics my student asked me to help with and I am happy with the results ❤\uFE0F\n\nI like the option to correct ready-made quizzes if necessary right in the draft - I don't need to copy everything in the document and edit it afterwards. \n\nThank you so much for providing an opportunity to use this wonderful tool! It saved me a lot of time indeed, because I drastically lack time to get ready for the lessons properly. I'll buy the subscription since the next month \uD83D\uDE4F"
